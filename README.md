*A comprehensive repository for scientific machine learning data models and tools*

</div>

## 📚 Overview

SciMLHub fills a critical gap in the scientific ML ecosystem by providing a data-centric, unified repository of curated datasets spanning multiple engineering and scientific domains, with governance, transformation pipelines, and collaboration tools. Unlike existing frameworks that focus on model development and assume users bring their own data, SciMLHub complements these tools by standardizing and streamlining access to high-quality data. SciMLHub aims to accelerate and democratize scientific machine learning by making high-quality datasets and tools accessible to both academia and industry, much like how HuggingFace has enabled rapid progress in computer vision, NLP, and large language models.
